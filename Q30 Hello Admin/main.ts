// Question 30:
// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing
// code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array,
//  and print a greeting to each user:

// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

let user_name: string[] = ["Admin", "Naveed", "Sajid", "Bilal", "Kashif"];

user_name.forEach((user_name) => {
  if (user_name === "Admin") {
    console.log("Hello Admin, would you like to see a status report?");
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello ${user_name}, thank you for logging in again.`);
  }
});
